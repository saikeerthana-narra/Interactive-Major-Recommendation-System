# Interactive Major Recommendation System- *Empowering Students with Data-Driven Insights* 

## EMBEDDED THE QUIZ IN UIUC WEBSITE

The Interactive Major Recommender project is a comprehensive and sophisticated system designed to guide individuals in making informed decisions about their academic majors. By leveraging data-driven methodologies, this project offers personalized recommendations for optimal academic pathways.

Using a user-friendly interface, students are guided through a series of questions and assessments that explore their interests, strengths, and goals. The system dynamically adapts the questions based on the responses provided, ensuring a personalized experience for each user. The collected data is then processed by taking into account various factors such as academic performance, aptitude assessments, extracurricular activities, and personal preferences that matches students with majors that align with their unique profiles. By considering both academic and non-academic aspects, the system aims to provide comprehensive and holistic recommendations. This empowers them to make well-informed decisions and align their academic pursuits with their long-term goals.

The Major Recommender not only benefits students but also assists academic advisors, universities, and policymakers. The data-driven approach provides valuable insights into student preferences, trends in major selection, and the effectiveness of educational programs. This information can be used to enhance curriculum design, resource allocation, and career counseling services.

In summary, the interactive Major Recommender project combines cutting-edge technology, comprehensive data analysis, and personalized assessments to guide students towards optimal academic pathways. By harnessing the power of data and algorithms, it aims to revolutionize the process of major selection and empower students to make informed decisions about their educational journeys.
